  <p>[4/4/2023] I'm retiring for a while. I've been doing a lot of work on TransCube, our websites, and more over the last few months, and I need a break. My productivity has dropped off dramatically due to not being able to do my programming at school anymore, and so I decided it would be a good time to take a break, focus on schoolwork and test prep, and relax. I don't know when I'll be back, but I'll update this site eventually.</p>
